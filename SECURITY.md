# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, this open-source project is in its developmental stage and no specific versions have been published yet. Consequently, no versions are being supported with security updates. We highly appreciate the community's involvement in testing and improving the software during this phase.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in our software, please use the following process for responsible disclosure:

1. Raise an issue in GitHub detailing the vulnerability.  Security issues are taken seriously and want to ensure they are handled appropriately.
2. The issue will be triaged and appropriate fixes will be incorporated into development.

If you're not sure if something is a security issue or not, please err on the side of caution and raise an issue.

## Policy Adoption

This Security Policy has been adapted from standard practices in the open-source community. We appreciate any suggestions for improvements. Please create a non-security issue for such discussions.
